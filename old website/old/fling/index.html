		<p>"Classy stuff from folks high on artistry" <br /> <strong>Jackie Hayden, Hot Press</strong></p>
		<p>"I can see them being mega in the folk world." <br /> <strong>Peter Nagle, 2 U I Bestow music blog.</strong> </p>
		<p>"This is a band that are incredible fun to listen on CD, but I feel that to truly appreciate these fantastic musicians you need to see them live! Never before has music of this genre achieved all it can through recordings, it is something you need to experience. " <br /> <strong>Declan O'Toole, Music Review Unsigned</strong> </p>
		<p>"Fling are an exciting Galway based five-piece who have been gigging solidly since their formation earlier this year. Their music, to take liberties with the famous Star Trek saying, is “trad, Jim, but not as we know it’, encompassing influences from Russia to South America, while remaining rooted in Irish trad and American bluegrass music." <br /> <strong>Jimi MCDonnell, The Connacht Tribune</strong></p>
		<p>"Fling is an apt name for this band. The music is a gentle concoction of strings, airy winds and big drums, with the instrumentals are pure class. On the occasions where they sing, such as on The Mountain, their voices bring a slow-dance Nashville edge, which is both compelling and emotive – with slow, sing-along harmonies." <br /> <strong>Alice Sage, For Folks Sake New Bands Panel</strong></p>
		<p>"They're amazing. Bluegrass, traditional and gypsy sounds inform the melodies with killer harmonies, deadly rhythms and a big ol' double bass slapping away. There's a coherence here which belies their brief union." <br /> <strong>John Donnellan, Hot Press</strong> </p>

		<h1>About</h1>
		
		<p>Fling is a coming together of like-minded individuals who share a joy in both music and travel, each one an accomplished musician in their own right. The resultant music is a blend of traditions and styles, a 'world' music,  that has twangs of bluegrass, Irish trad and good ol' rock and roll. Their influences range from Planxty and Lunasa to Rory Gallagher and Led Zeppellin.</p>
		
		<p>Although only together for  a year and a half, Fling have already played many a gig including  the Electric Picnic, Body and Soul, Spirit of Folk festival, Green Village Festival, Festival of the Fires, the White Horse Sessions, the Galway-Sterling Sessions and were headliners at the Galway Americana Festival 2010. They were also invited by Guinness to perform as part of their Arthur's Day celebrations in Campbell's Tavern, Galway. Boyle's of Slane named them as one of the best acts ever to have performed there. It has been a very busy year for Fling.</p> 
		
		<p>Fling have been flying literally around the world playing their music. Most recently they have toured in Denmark where along with playing sell out cultural festivals and Irish events, they also played in schools, promoting Irish music and culture to eager music students. They have been invited back in January for an even more extensive tour.  February saw them complete a sell-out tour of Northern Spain. One of the highlights of their inaugural year was when they were invited to Shanghai, China where they performed at the St. Patrick's celebrations.</p>
		
		<p>Tours in the UK, France and Scandanavia are coming up soon and the band are heading back to China early next year.</p>
		
		<p>Fling have received a very warm reaction from media and audiences and their music has been played on many radio stations, both nationally and internationally. Radio stations include Lyric FM (Ireland), Radio Liberté (France), Radio Gallego ( Spain), WIKN (USA), Amazingtunes.fm (UK), Radio 2 (Holland)</p>
		
		<p>Fling have just released their debut album, eponymously named "Fling". The album was recorded at Grouse Lodge in Westmeath and Sun St. studios in Tuam  with the legendary Kenny Ralph, and the incredible musicianship has been enriched with guest musicians such as Steve Wickham from the Waterboys who adds his violin virtuosity on a couple of tracks. It was produced by Derek Murray (The Stunning),who also plays on a track, and mixed by Trevor Hutchinson (Lunasa), which all adds up to a fantastic sound!</p>  
		
		<p>Fling are:</p>

		<p><strong>Pauli Smalls</strong> - Djangoesque slapping and tickling of the Double Bass.</p>

		<p><strong>Liam Carroll</strong> - has carried his Guitar and Mandolin around the world a few times and came home with a Charango.</p>

		<p><strong>Liam Conway</strong> - a self confessed perfectionist, weaves his subtle magic on Guitar and Mandolin.</p>

		<p><strong>Maeve Kelly</strong> - has no fear of stretching the imagination with the Feadóg (tin whistle) and Low Whistle, using techniques picked up from all around the world. </p>
