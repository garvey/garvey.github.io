	<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>

	<h3>Hi, I'm Gearoid. <span class="text-muted font-16">(pronounced Gar-road)</span></h3>

	<p>Born and raised in the west of Ireland in a small Irish speaking town called An Cheathr√∫ Rua, I am a sports fanatic with a passion for all things nerdy. These include comic books, video games, learning new web-languagues and keeping up to date with what's going on in the world of web development.                            </p>

	<p>I graduated from Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Tecnology in 2008 with a BSc in Computing in Multimedia Programming and sensing the approaching financial recession decided to hit the books for another year and achieved a BSc (Honours) in Computing in Multimedia Systems/Web Engineering in 2009. </p>

	<p>After University I was employed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.visrez.com">visrez</a> for four years as a front end developer/UI designer. I left Visrez in August 2013 to see the world and to experience new cultures. </p>

	<p>After traveling South America I settled down in wellington, New Zealand working for <a target="blank" href="www.kineo.co.nz">Kineo Pacific</a> as a front end developer for eleven months on a working holiday visa.</p>
